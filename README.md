This repository contains Python solutions and examples focusing on conditional statements and loops.
  It includes: 

Conditional Statements: Demonstrations of if, elif, and else statements for decision-making based on various conditions.  

Loops: Usage of for and while loops to iterate through data structures, repeat tasks, and handle complex logic.  

Practical Examples: Real-world examples showing how to use conditional logic and loops together, such as filtering data, counting occurrences, and implementing repetitive operations efficiently. 

Each example is designed to reinforce foundational programming concepts and illustrate efficient coding practices in Python. Perfect for beginners or anyone looking to strengthen their grasp on Python control structures!
